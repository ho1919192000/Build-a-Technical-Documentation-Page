                    <p>CSS Grid helps you easily build complex web designs. It works by turning an HTML element into a grid container with rows and columns for you to place children elements where you want within the grid.</p>
                    <h3>Why CSS Grid is better than Bootstrap for creating layouts?</h3>

                    <li>Your markup will be simpler: Swapping out Bootstrap with CSS Grid will make your HTML cleaner. While this isn’t the most important benefit, it’s likely the first one you’ll notice.
                    </li>
                    <li>Much more flexibility: Let’s say you want to change your layout according to the screen size. For example pull the menu up to the top row when it’s being viewed on mobile.</li>
                    <li>No more 12 column limitation: This isn’t as huge problem, but it has annoyed several times. As the Bootstrap grid is split into twelve columns, you’ll go into trouble if you want a five column layout. Or seven. Or nine. Or anything that doesn’t add up to twelve.</li>
                    <li>
                        Browser support: Before we end we of course have to talk about browser support as well. At the time of writing this article, 75% of global website traffic supports CSS Grid.
                    </li>
                    <li>Complexity of layout: CSS Grid unlike with Bootstrap, CSS Grid markup won’t grow much in complexity as the layout grows in complexity.</li>

                    <p>Turn any HTML element into a grid container by setting its <code>display</code> property to <code>grid</code>. This gives you the ability to use all the other properties associated with CSS Grid.</p>
                    <h3>Note</h3>
                    <p>In CSS Grid, the parent element is referred to as the <em>container</em> and its children are called <em>items</em>.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <code class="code-section">display: grid;</code>

                    CSS Grid: Add Columns with grid-template-columns
                </header>
                <article>
                    <p>Simply creating a grid element doesn't get you very far. You need to define the structure of the grid as well. To add some columns to the grid, use the <code>grid-template-columns</code> property on a grid container as demonstrated below:</p>
                    <code class="code-section">
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px;
}
                    </code>
                    <p>This will give your grid two columns that are 50px wide each.</p>
                    <p>The number of parameters given to the <code>grid-template-columns</code> property indicates the number of columns in the grid, and the value of each parameter indicates the width of each column.</p>

                <header id="Add_Rows_with grid-template-rows"> Add Rows with grid-template-rows</header>
                <article>
                    <p>The grid you created in the last challenge will set the number of rows automatically. To adjust the rows manually, use the <code>grid-template-rows</code> property in the same way you used <code>grid-template-columns</code> in previous challenge.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <code class="code-section">grid-template-rows: 50px 50px;</code>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <p>You can use absolute and relative units like <code>px</code> and <code>em</code> in CSS Grid to define the size of rows and columns. You can use these as well:</p>
                    <li><code>fr</code>: sets the column or row to a fraction of the available space,</li>
                    <li><code>auto</code>: sets the column or row to the width or height of its content automatically,</li>
                    <li><code>%</code>: adjusts the column or row to the percent width of its container.</li>
                    <p>Here's the code that generates the output in the preview:</p>
                    <code class="code-section">grid-template-columns: auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr;</code>
                    <p>This snippet creates five columns. The first column is as wide as its content, the second column is 50px, the third column is 10% of its container, and for the last two columns; the remaining space is divided into three sections, two are allocated for the fourth column, and one for the fifth.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>So far in the grids you have created, the columns have all been tight up against each other. Sometimes you want a gap in between the columns. To add a gap between the columns, use the <code>grid-column-gap</code> property like this:</p>
                    <code class="code-section">grid-column-gap: 10px;</code>
                    <p>This creates 10px of empty space between all of our columns.
                    </p>

                <header id="Create_a_Row_Gap_using_grid-row-gap"></header>
                <p>You can add a gap in between the rows of a grid using <code>grid-row-gap</code> in the same way that you added a gap in between columns in the previous challenge.</p>
                <code class="code-section">grid-row-gap: 5px;</code>

                </header>
                <p><code>grid-gap</code> is a shorthand property for <code>grid-row-gap</code> and <code>grid-column-gap</code> from the previous two challenges that's more convenient to use. If <code>grid-gap</code> has one value, it will create a gap between all rows and columns. However, if there are two values, it will use the first one to set the gap between the rows and the second value for the columns.</p>
                <code class="code-section">grid-gap: 10px 20px;</code>
