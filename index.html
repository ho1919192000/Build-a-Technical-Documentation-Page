                    <p>CSS Grid helps you easily build complex web designs. It works by turning an HTML element into a grid container with rows and columns for you to place children elements where you want within the grid.</p>
                    <h3>Why CSS Grid is better than Bootstrap for creating layouts?</h3>

                    <li>Your markup will be simpler: Swapping out Bootstrap with CSS Grid will make your HTML cleaner. While this isn’t the most important benefit, it’s likely the first one you’ll notice.
                    </li>
                    <li>Much more flexibility: Let’s say you want to change your layout according to the screen size. For example pull the menu up to the top row when it’s being viewed on mobile.</li>
                    <li>No more 12 column limitation: This isn’t as huge problem, but it has annoyed several times. As the Bootstrap grid is split into twelve columns, you’ll go into trouble if you want a five column layout. Or seven. Or nine. Or anything that doesn’t add up to twelve.</li>
                    <li>
                        Browser support: Before we end we of course have to talk about browser support as well. At the time of writing this article, 75% of global website traffic supports CSS Grid.
                    </li>
                    <li>Complexity of layout: CSS Grid unlike with Bootstrap, CSS Grid markup won’t grow much in complexity as the layout grows in complexity.</li>

                    <p>Turn any HTML element into a grid container by setting its <code>display</code> property to <code>grid</code>. This gives you the ability to use all the other properties associated with CSS Grid.</p>
                    <h3>Note</h3>
                    <p>In CSS Grid, the parent element is referred to as the <em>container</em> and its children are called <em>items</em>.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <code class="code-section">display: grid;</code>

                    CSS Grid: Add Columns with grid-template-columns
                </header>
                <article>
                    <p>Simply creating a grid element doesn't get you very far. You need to define the structure of the grid as well. To add some columns to the grid, use the <code>grid-template-columns</code> property on a grid container as demonstrated below:</p>
                    <code class="code-section">
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px;
}
                    </code>
                    <p>This will give your grid two columns that are 50px wide each.</p>
                    <p>The number of parameters given to the <code>grid-template-columns</code> property indicates the number of columns in the grid, and the value of each parameter indicates the width of each column.</p>
